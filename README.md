# How to install or remove

## Prerequisites
To use the installation with make it's necessary to have gnu stow installed previously

For debian/ubuntu this can be achieved with

```
sudo apt-get install stow
```

This package needs to be checked out to `$HOME/dotfiles`

## Usage
Use `make` or `make all` to install dotfiles and `make clean` to remove dotfiles
